# Params

Control your website content using query parameters.

## Installation

Add `Params` to your project using npm:

```bash
npm install @burcs/params
```

Or, embed the script directly on your website.

## Quick Start

`Params` is designed for ease of use. Modify content based on the order of site elements. For example, to alter the second paragraph on a page:

```html
https://params.org/page?p_2=updated+content+here
```

## Party Mode ðŸŽ‰

Activate "Party Mode" to effortlessly update your site. By enabling this mode, you can edit your page content in-line. Try it out:

```html
https://params.org/page?party=true
```

Make your changes, enjoy the party!

Currently, `Params` supports:

- Headings: `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`
- Text & Styling: `p`, `i`, `b`, `span`

More elements are in the pipeline.

## Styling on the Fly
